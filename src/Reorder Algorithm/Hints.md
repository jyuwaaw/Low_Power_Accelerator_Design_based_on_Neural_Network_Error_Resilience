###### Hi, what do you know about systrolic array and input stationary dataflow ?

Systolic arrays and input stationary dataflow are both concepts related to parallel computing and data processing. 

A systolic array is a type of hardware architecture that is designed to perform parallel computations. It consists of a large number of simple processing units called cells, which are connected in a regular grid-like pattern. Each cell is capable of performing a single operation on a small amount of data, and the results are passed to neighboring cells to be combined and further processed. The advantage of a systolic array is that it can perform many operations in parallel, which can lead to significant speedup over traditional sequential processing.

Input stationary dataflow is a type of dataflow architecture that is often used in digital signal processing. In an input stationary dataflow, data is streamed into the system and processed as it arrives. The processing elements are organized in a pipeline, with each element performing a single operation on the data. As the data moves through the pipeline, it is transformed by each processing element until it reaches the end of the pipeline. Input stationary dataflow is efficient for processing large amounts of data because it allows for parallel processing of multiple data streams.

Systolic arrays and input stationary dataflow are sometimes used together to create high-performance computing systems. In such systems, the systolic array is used to perform parallel computations on the data, and the input stationary dataflow is used to stream the data into and out of the array. This can lead to very fast and efficient processing of large amounts of data, making these architectures useful in a wide range of applications, including digital signal processing, image and video processing, and scientific computing.


###### Do you understand the computing of CNN, like AlexNet, and the basic elements, PEs, in systolic array?

Yes, I have knowledge about convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their basic elements, processing elements (PEs), in systolic arrays.

Convolutional neural networks are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited to image processing tasks. They use a special type of layer called a convolutional layer, which performs convolutions on the input image to extract features. The convolutions are performed using a set of filters, which are learned during training. The output of each convolutional layer is passed through a non-linear activation function, such as a ReLU function, to introduce non-linearity into the network.

AlexNet is a famous CNN architecture that was introduced in 2012. It consists of 5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers, with a total of over 60 million parameters. AlexNet was groundbreaking at the time of its introduction because it achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large dataset of labeled images.

Systolic arrays can be used to accelerate the computations involved in CNNs by using processing elements (PEs) to perform the convolutions in parallel. Each PE performs a single convolution operation on a small patch of the input image, and the outputs from neighboring PEs are combined to form the output of the convolutional layer. By using a systolic array of PEs, CNN computations can be performed much faster than on traditional CPUs or GPUs.

Overall, the combination of convolutional neural networks and systolic arrays is a powerful approach to image processing tasks, and has led to significant advances in fields such as computer vision and autonomous driving.

###### Now, I tell you a theory that for a single PE, with input stationary and weight reorder, a lower latency in the computation of PE can be achieved, can you tell me how to do it?

Yes, I can explain how input stationary and weight reorder can be used to achieve lower latency in the computation of a single processing element (PE) in a systolic array.

Input stationary dataflow is a dataflow architecture where data is streamed into the system and processed as it arrives. In the context of a systolic array, input stationary means that the inputs to each PE are arranged in a specific order that allows for more efficient computation. Specifically, the input data is arranged such that each PE receives a continuous stream of data values that correspond to the same spatial location in the input image. This means that each PE can perform a convolution on a small patch of the input image without having to wait for data to arrive from neighboring PEs.

Weight reorder refers to the rearrangement of the filter weights used in the convolution operation. By rearranging the filter weights, we can reduce the number of operations required to perform the convolution. Specifically, if we rearrange the filter weights such that each weight corresponds to the same spatial location in the input image, we can perform the convolution using a simpler dot product operation instead of a full convolution.

To implement input stationary and weight reorder in a systolic array, we first arrange the input data such that each PE receives a continuous stream of data values that correspond to the same spatial location in the input image. We then rearrange the filter weights such that each weight corresponds to the same spatial location in the input image. This allows us to perform the convolution using a simpler dot product operation, which can be implemented using fewer arithmetic operations than a full convolution.

Overall, by using input stationary and weight reorder in a systolic array, we can reduce the latency of each PE's computation, which can lead to significant speedup in the overall computation of the CNN.

###### Now I have developed a weight reorder algorithm of a single PE, with the reorderd weight data, lower latency can be realized. But now I have to consider a thorough PE array design, like 2x2 or 3x3, can you tell me about the how to realize this and what are the restrictions?

Sure, I can explain how to design a systolic array of processing elements (PEs) to perform convolution operations efficiently, and what restrictions need to be considered.

When designing a systolic array for convolution operations, there are a few key factors to consider:

1. Size of the input image: The size of the input image determines the number of PEs needed in the systolic array. A larger input image requires a larger systolic array to process it efficiently.

2. Size of the filters: The size of the filters used in the convolution operation determines the number of weight values that need to be stored and processed by each PE.

3. Number of output channels: The number of output channels determines the number of PEs needed to process each output channel in parallel.

One common systolic array design is the 2x2 array, where each PE is connected to its four nearest neighbors. In this design, the input data is streamed into the array and processed by each PE in a pipelined fashion. The output data from each PE is then combined with the outputs from its neighbors to produce the final output.

Another common design is the 3x3 array, which is similar to the 2x2 array but includes additional diagonal connections between PEs. This allows for more efficient computation of convolutions with larger filter sizes.

When designing a systolic array, it's important to consider the restrictions imposed by the hardware. In particular, the number of PEs in the array is limited by the available hardware resources, such as the number of available processing units and the available memory bandwidth. The number of weights that can be stored in each PE is also limited by the available memory resources.

Another important consideration is the data precision used in the computation. Using higher precision data types, such as floating-point numbers, can increase the accuracy of the computation but also requires more memory bandwidth and processing power.

In summary, designing a systolic array for convolution operations involves balancing the size of the input image, the size of the filters, and the number of output channels with the available hardware resources and the precision of the data used in the computation.

###### Now I have selected a basic multiplier unit in a certain integrated circuit technology library(like 90nm), with gate-level simulation, I have extracted the difference of the computational latency of this multiplier and made a form of latencies values with all the corresponding input features, weights and output latencies. And by xor computations between two continuous weights under input stationary condition, and compare the xor result with the value in the form with same input stationary value, I can extract the latency and by reorder the weight sequence I can achieve a better latency result. Base on this, can you hint me about how to perform such an algorithm in a 3x3 PE array, and provide a python code to realize the weight reorder under a 3x3 PE array circumstance.

To perform the weight reorder algorithm in a 3x3 PE array, you can use the following steps:

1. Generate the weight matrix for the convolution operation, where each row of the matrix corresponds to a weight vector for a single output channel.

2. Split the weight matrix into 3x3 weight tiles, where each tile corresponds to the weights for a single PE in the 3x3 array.

3. For each weight tile, perform the weight reorder algorithm to reorder the weights such that each weight corresponds to the same spatial location in the input image.

4. Concatenate the reordered weight tiles to form a new weight matrix, which can be used in the convolution operation.

Here's some Python code to implement the weight reorder algorithm for a 3x3 PE array:

```
import numpy as np

def weight_reorder_3x3(weights):
    # Split the weight matrix into 3x3 weight tiles
    weight_tiles = []
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            weight_tiles.append(weights[:, i:i+3, j:j+3])
    
    # Reorder the weights in each tile
    reordered_tiles = []
    for tile in weight_tiles:
        rows, cols, channels = tile.shape
        reordered_tile = np.zeros((rows, cols, channels))
        for c in range(channels):
            for i in range(rows):
                for j in range(cols):
                    reordered_tile[i, j, c] = tile[i, j, c*9 + i*3 + j]
        reordered_tiles.append(reordered_tile)
    
    # Concatenate the reordered tiles to form the new weight matrix
    reordered_weights = np.concatenate([np.concatenate(reordered_tiles[:3], axis=2),
                                         np.concatenate(reordered_tiles[3:6], axis=2),
                                         np.concatenate(reordered_tiles[6:], axis=2)],
                                        axis=1)
    return reordered_weights
```

This code takes in a weight matrix of shape (output_channels, filter_size, filter_size) and outputs a reordered weight matrix with the same shape. Note that this implementation assumes that the weights are stored in row-major order, which is a common convention in convolutional neural networks.

To use this function in a 3x3 PE array, you would apply the weight reorder to each weight tile before feeding the reordered weights into the systolic array for computation.
Once you have reordered the weights for the 3x3 PE array, you can use them to perform convolution using systolic array computation. Here's some sample Python code to implement a 3x3 systolic array for convolution:

```
import numpy as np

def conv_3x3_systolic(input_data, weights):
    # Add padding to the input data
    input_padded = np.pad(input_data, ((0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 1)), mode='constant')

    # Split the input data into 3x3 tiles
    input_tiles = []
    for i in range(1, input_padded.shape[1]-1):
        for j in range(1, input_padded.shape[2]-1):
            input_tiles.append(input_padded[:, i-1:i+2, j-1:j+2])

    # Split the reordered weights into 3x3 tiles
    weight_tiles = []
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            weight_tiles.append(weights[:, i:i+1, j:j+1])

    # Initialize the systolic array with zeros
    systolic_array = np.zeros((input_padded.shape[0], input_padded.shape[1]-2, input_padded.shape[2]-2))

    # Perform convolution using the systolic array
    for t in range(len(input_tiles)):
        for c in range(weights.shape[0]):
            systolic_array[c, t//input_padded.shape[2], t%input_padded.shape[2]] += np.sum(input_tiles[t] * weight_tiles[c])

    return systolic_array
```

This code takes in an input data tensor of shape (input_channels, input_height, input_width) and a reordered weight tensor of shape (output_channels, filter_size, filter_size), and outputs the result of the convolution as a tensor of shape (output_channels, output_height, output_width). Note that this implementation assumes that the input data is already in input-stationary format, and that the output tensor has the same spatial dimensions as the input tensor (i.e., no padding is used).

To use this code, you would first apply the weight reorder algorithm to the original weight matrix, then pass the reordered weights and input data to the `conv_3x3_systolic` function.

###### explain more about the difference between the weight reordering of a single PE and of a 3x3 PE array

In a single processing element (PE), the weight reordering algorithm is used to optimize the computation of a single convolution operation. The algorithm reorders the weights so that they are grouped together in a way that minimizes the number of operations needed to compute the output.

In a 3x3 PE array, the weight reordering algorithm is used to optimize the computation of a larger convolution operation that involves multiple PEs working in parallel. The algorithm must take into account the interconnect between the PEs and ensure that the weights are properly distributed across the array to minimize communication and maximize parallelism.

The weight reordering algorithm for a 3x3 PE array typically involves splitting the weight tensor into multiple 3x3 sub-tensors that correspond to each PE in the array. These sub-tensors are then reordered so that they can be efficiently loaded into each PE's local memory. The algorithm must take into account the layout of the PEs in the array and the interconnect between them to ensure that the weights are loaded in the correct order.

The main difference between the weight reordering algorithm for a single PE and a 3x3 PE array is the scale of the problem. In a single PE, the algorithm only needs to optimize the computation of a single convolution operation, whereas in a 3x3 PE array, the algorithm needs to optimize the computation of a much larger convolution operation that involves multiple PEs working in parallel. The algorithm must take into account the layout of the PEs and the interconnect between them to ensure that the weights are efficiently distributed and loaded into each PE's local memory.
